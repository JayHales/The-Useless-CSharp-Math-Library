# The-Useless-Math-Library
A useless CSharp math library with loads of stuff you would never need to use.

Basically just a compilation of math classes, functions and methods which I keep adding to as I learn them. 

At the moment there is:

- Sine and cosine functions
  - Derived from the Taylor series
- Eulers number
  - Derived from the Taylor series
- Factorial
  - As an override on `double`
- Vectors
  - Multiplication and division
  - Addition and subtract
  - Cross product
  - Dot product
  - Angle between
